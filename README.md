Simple npm init bin package to add the perfect release-plan setup

This will do the following:

* add `release-plan` dependency,
* add required `.github/workflows` files
* add a `CHANGELOG.md`
* add a `RELEASE.md`
* update your repository's labels with sensible defaults

## Usage

### Prerequisites

1. Obtain a [GitHub personal access token][generate-token].
2. Make sure the token is available as the `GITHUB_AUTH` environment variable.
  For instance:
  ```bash
  export GITHUB_AUTH=abc123def456
  ```

### Freshly Configuring a Repo

When you want to set up a repo with `release-plan`, you can run:

```
npm init release-plan-setup
```

### Updating an Already Configured Repo

If you'd like to update an existing repo to use the latest and greatest setup, you can run:

```
npm init release-plan-setup@latest
```

### Only Sync Labels

If you'd like to run only the label sync, you can do that with:

```
npm init release-plan-setup --labels-only
```
